        text: `The wind whipped around you, a raw, untamed force that tugged at your coat as you stood on the precipice of the city. Hundreds of feet below, the metropolis sprawled like a glittering, chaotic web, its lights mimicking the distant, cold stars. From this vantage point, the individual dramas and petty squabbles of its inhabitants were muted, almost insignificant. But you felt them, a discordant hum that vibrated through the steel and concrete beneath your boots.

You never knew its origin. It simply was. A seed planted in your youth, its tendrils slowly wrapping around your consciousness. Sometimes, in the quiet moments, you'd try to trace it back, to pinpoint the moment it began. A fleeting encounter? A strange touch? A whispered word you couldn't recall? The memory remained elusive, shrouded in the mists of childhood.

But the clarity it brought was undeniable. You saw the world not as it appeared, but as it felt. And the overwhelming sensation was one of decay. The vibrant energies were too often tainted, corrupted by malice, fear, and deceit. The city pulsed with a sickly rhythm, a stark contrast to the harmonious potential you instinctively knew existed.

The realization solidified over time, a cold certainty that settled deep within your bones. This wasn't how things were meant to be. This world was broken, drowning in its own negative vibrations. And you, the one gifted with the ability to truly feel its sickness, were the only one who could heal it – even if that healing required a radical reconstruction.`

        text: `The bad buzzing in the city wasn't just one big feeling; it was made up of how each person felt. You could understand these feelings like a secret language. Over time, you learned to see the small differences in people's energy. Bright, steady lights meant they were good and calm – but you didn't see that much. Usually, you saw messy, shaky lights that meant people were scared, angry, or lying. That was the main bad feeling of the city.

But you could see more than just good and bad. You could also see how strong or weak someone was. Strong people had bright, powerful energy around them. Even if someone looked normal, you could feel the strong power hidden inside them. Weak people had energy that flickered and wasn't steady. Even if they looked tough, you could find their weak points.

The heroes, the Marvels, were like super bright lights in all this darkness. Each one had a different, strong energy that showed how powerful they were. You could feel their amazing strength. They were going to be hard to fight.

But even though they were strong, you could still see little problems in their energy. Maybe one hero had a small bit of doubt even though they seemed sure of themselves. Maybe another hero depended too much on one power, so if you took that away, they'd be weak. You could see these small cracks in their strong armor.`

        text: `You were in your main hideout, with a glowing map of the city in front of you. Every flashing light and line showed a super important part of the city – and where you could cause trouble. You had one goal: to change the world and get rid of all the bad stuff you saw in it. But the "heroes," who thought they knew what was right, were in your way.

            Fine. You'd get them out of the way.

            You smiled as you looked at your plan. It was a complicated but perfect way to make chaos. First, you'd make a few things happen to cause trouble and keep the heroes busy. A fire in the factories would bring the fire-based heroes. Problems with the subway, stopping trains and trapping people, would bring the strong heroes who like big rescues.

            And then, there was Spiderman.

            You knew how he acted, always wanting to save people. He'd rush to where people were most scared and needed help. And that's exactly where you'd be waiting.

            The map showed a close-up of a place: an old, broken-down power plant where the city's energy felt wild and dangerous. You had a special trap set up there for Spiderman. The chaos you caused wouldn't just keep the other heroes busy; it would also make things just right for your attack. All the strong feelings – fear and worry – would make your own powers stronger.

            You'd be waiting in the shadows of the power plant, ready to attack when Spiderman was weak. The other heroes might be tough, but Spiderman was fast and unpredictable. To beat him, you had to catch him alone and at the right moment. And the chaos you were about to unleash on the city was the perfect way to do it.`
